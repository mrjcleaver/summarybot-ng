3. Add OpenAI API integration (NFR004, R001, R002)
4. Define security framework (SEC001, SEC002, SEC003, SEC006)
5. Implement basic error handling (ERR004)

### Phase 2 (Short Term - Medium Priority)
1. Add webhook infrastructure (R016, NFR006)
2. Implement monitoring and metrics (NFR009, NFR010, NFR011)
3. Add configuration management (NFR007, NFR008)
4. Implement core summarization features (R003, R004, R008)
5. Add scalability requirements (SCALE001, SCALE002)

### Phase 3 (Medium Term - Enhanced Features)
1. Advanced filtering and configuration (R019, R020, R022)
2. Scheduled processing (R011, R014)
3. Enhanced error handling (ERR001, ERR002, ERR003)
4. Performance optimization (SCALE003, SCALE004)

### Phase 4 (Long Term - Polish Features)
1. UI/UX enhancements (R005, R006, R023)
2. Advanced integrations (R018, R021, R024)
3. Advanced monitoring and analytics

## Traceability Validation Rules

1. **Completeness**: Every requirement must map to at least one implementation component
2. **Consistency**: Requirements should not conflict with each other
3. **Testability**: Every requirement must have defined acceptance criteria
4. **Priority Alignment**: High-priority requirements should be implemented first
5. **Risk Management**: High-risk requirements need mitigation strategies

## Change Impact Analysis Framework

When requirements change:
1. Identify affected components using this matrix
2. Assess testing impact across related requirements
3. Update architecture components as needed
4. Validate requirement consistency
5. Update implementation priority
