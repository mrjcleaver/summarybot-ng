## Next Phase Preparation

### Phase 2: Deliverable Consolidation
1. **Integration Review**: Cross-validate agent outputs
2. **Quality Assessment**: Ensure completeness and consistency  
3. **Documentation Package**: Combine all deliverables
4. **Traceability Matrix**: Link requirements to architecture
5. **Final Validation**: Security and technical review

### Phase 3: Project Completion
1. **Final Documentation**: Consolidated package creation
2. **Metrics Generation**: Performance and completion statistics
3. **Handoff Preparation**: Ready for development team
4. **Lessons Learned**: Coordination improvements documentation

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks: **LOW**
- All agents executing normally
- No coordination bottlenecks identified
- Memory system operating efficiently
- Hook integrations successful
