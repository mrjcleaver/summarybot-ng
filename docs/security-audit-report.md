### Detailed Security Analysis

#### 1. Critical Findings (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
**Status:** None identified (pre-implementation phase)

#### 2. High Risk Findings (CVSS 7.0-8.9)

**H1: Missing Secrets Management Architecture (CVSS 8.1)**
- **Finding:** No concrete secrets management implementation defined
- **Impact:** Risk of hardcoded API keys, Discord tokens, OpenAI keys
- **Evidence:** Requirements specify "secrets management integration" but no implementation
- **Recommendation:** Implement HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or environment-based secrets

**H2: Insufficient Authentication Architecture (CVSS 7.8)**
- **Finding:** JWT authentication planned but implementation details unclear
- **Impact:** Potential for weak authentication implementation
- **Evidence:** NFR-4.1.1 mentions JWT but lacks specific implementation guidance
- **Recommendation:** Define JWT implementation with proper key rotation and secure storage

**H3: Webhook Security Architecture Risk (CVSS 7.5)**
- **Finding:** Webhook endpoint security not comprehensively defined
- **Impact:** Risk of unauthorized webhook access and data exposure
- **Evidence:** Port 5000 webhook server planned without detailed security controls
- **Recommendation:** Implement webhook signature validation, IP whitelisting, rate limiting

#### 3. Medium Risk Findings (CVSS 4.0-6.9)

**M1: Input Validation Framework Missing (CVSS 6.2)**
- **Finding:** Requirements mention validation but lack specific implementation
- **Impact:** Potential for injection attacks when implemented
- **Recommendation:** Define comprehensive input validation schema

**M2: Data Retention Policy Unclear (CVSS 5.8)**
- **Finding:** Discord message processing privacy implications undefined
- **Impact:** Potential GDPR/privacy compliance issues
- **Recommendation:** Define explicit data retention and deletion policies

**M3: Dependency Security Management (CVSS 5.5)**
- **Finding:** Poetry dependency management without security scanning defined
- **Impact:** Risk of vulnerable dependencies
- **Recommendation:** Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning

**M4: Error Handling Security (CVSS 5.2)**
- **Finding:** Error handling security implications not addressed
- **Impact:** Potential information disclosure through error messages
- **Recommendation:** Define secure error handling patterns

**M5: Logging Security Framework (CVSS 4.8)**
- **Finding:** Comprehensive logging planned but security aspects unclear
- **Impact:** Potential for sensitive data in logs
- **Recommendation:** Define secure logging practices with data sanitization

#### 4. Low Risk Findings (CVSS 0.1-3.9)

**L1: Security Headers Configuration (CVSS 3.5)**
- **Finding:** Web security headers not specified for webhook API
- **Recommendation:** Implement HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options headers

**L2: Rate Limiting Granularity (CVSS 3.2)**
- **Finding:** Basic rate limiting planned but lacking granular controls
- **Recommendation:** Implement per-user, per-endpoint rate limiting

**L3: Security Monitoring Integration (CVSS 2.8)**
- **Finding:** Monitoring planned but security-specific monitoring unclear
- **Recommendation:** Add security-focused monitoring and alerting

**L4: Container Security Configuration (CVSS 2.5)**
- **Finding:** Docker-in-Docker with privileged mode in devcontainer
- **Recommendation:** Review privileged container requirements for production

### Compliance Assessment
