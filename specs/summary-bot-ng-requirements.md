# Summary Bot NG - Project Requirements

## Project Vision
An AI-powered document summarization tool leveraging Claude API integration for intelligent content analysis and summarization.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Document Processing**
   - Support multiple file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, HTML)
   - Batch processing capabilities
   - Real-time processing for smaller documents

2. **AI Summarization**
   - Integration with Claude API for intelligent summarization
   - Configurable summary lengths (brief, standard, detailed)
   - Context-aware summarization with topic extraction

3. **User Interface**
   - Web-based interface for document upload
   - Progress tracking for batch operations
   - Summary export options (PDF, DOCX, JSON)

4. **API Integration**
   - RESTful API for programmatic access
   - Webhook support for async processing notifications
   - Rate limiting and quota management

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Support processing documents up to 50MB
   - Response time < 30 seconds for standard documents
   - Concurrent processing of up to 10 documents

2. **Security**
   - Secure file upload with validation
   - API key management for Claude integration
   - Data privacy compliance (GDPR ready)

3. **Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling capability
   - Queue-based processing for large batches
   - Caching layer for frequently accessed summaries

4. **Reliability**
   - 99.5% uptime target
   - Error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Logging and monitoring integration

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for metadata, Redis for caching
